Despite its name, this is actually a Pokemon card battle game, due to the fact that the Pokemon API was proven to be much more usably populated with cards than its Final Fantasy counterpart.

##

Users begin by selecting the number of cards each player starts with, then once presented with their cards, which player's alternating turn begins is randomly selected. During a player's turn, the player may Attack the opposing card, reducing the opposing card's Stamina by an amount governed by the attacking card's attack stat and effected by the defending card's defense.

##

In future editions, a player will be able to use a healing item on their current card, or switch their current card to the bottom of their pile while the next card moves up.
